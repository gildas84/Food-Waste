# Food-Waste
This project tracks the creation of a blog post around food waste in London, which would aim at:
-	Identifying food waste as a global and a local issue and spread across the whole food supply chain (source:FAO & Courtauld report)
-	Identifying solutions implemented by London boroughs (source: Websites from boroughs)
-	Visualising treatment solutions implemented by London boroughs and volumes treated by each boroughs (source: me !)
-	Listing the pros and cons of the #1 solution adopted by most councils (i.e. anaerobic digestion/in-vessel composting)  (source: academic and non-academic sources)

This post is illustrated by data visualisations developed in Python
